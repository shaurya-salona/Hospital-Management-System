Based on the [Netlify support guide](https://answers.netlify.com/t/support-guide-i-ve-deployed-my-site-but-i-still-see-page-not-found/125/13), here's how to deploy your HMIS dashboard:

#### Steps:
1. **Prepare your files:**
   - Ensure all files are in the `frontend` directory
   - The `netlify.toml` file is already configured

   ```bash
   # Option A: Drag and drop
   # Simply drag the frontend folder to netlify.com/drop
   
   # Option B: Git integration
   # Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
   ```

3. **Configure build settings:**
   - Build command: `echo 'Static site - no build required'`
   - Publish directory: `.` (root of frontend folder)
   - Node version: 18

4. **Custom domain (optional):**
   - Add your custom domain in Netlify dashboard
   - Update DNS settings

### Option 2: Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: GitHub Pages

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to repository Settings > Pages
3. Select source: Deploy from a branch
4. Choose main branch and / (root) folder

### Option 4: Traditional Web Hosting

1. Upload all files to your web server's public directory
2. Ensure your server supports:
   - Static file serving
   - HTTPS (recommended)
